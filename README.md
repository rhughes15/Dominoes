# Dominoes
First CS351 Lab
A yellow box will appear in the center, waiting for you to drag your first domino to it.
Yellow rectangles will appear anywhere you can place a domino.
Drag and drop the dominoes to place them, if they can be placed, they will. If not they stay near the yellow rectangles,
but if they are dropped away from the rectangles they will be returned to your hand.
Click on the boneyard to draw.
The computer plays immediately after the human plays.
When the game ends, there will be a messge displayed in the console and it will wait for a text response,
but it can not restart in it's current version (I didn't have time to get to that) so the game can really only be
played once, then it needs to be closed and restarted.
